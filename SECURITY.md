# Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Simple Evite application.

## Security Headers

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Prevents XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- Allows only trusted domains for scripts, styles, and images
- Configured in `next.config.ts`

### HTTP Security Headers
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS protection
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to browser features

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Form Validation
- All user inputs are validated on both client and server side
- Input length limits enforced
- Special character filtering
- HTML sanitization using DOMPurify

### API Security
- Request body validation middleware
- Input sanitization before database operations
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Type checking and validation schemas

## Rate Limiting

### API Endpoints
- **RSVP Submissions**: 5 per minute per IP
- **API Requests**: 100 per minute per IP
- **Upload Requests**: 5 per 5 minutes per IP
- **Login Attempts**: 5 per 15 minutes per IP

### Implementation
- In-memory rate limiting for development
- Ready for Redis integration in production
- Configurable limits per endpoint

## Authentication & Authorization

### NextAuth.js Integration
- Secure session management
- Google OAuth integration
- JWT token validation
- Session-based authentication

### Access Control
- Private routes protected with middleware
- API endpoints with authentication requirements
- User-based resource access control
- Owner-only operations for sensitive data

## Data Protection

### Personal Information
- Minimal data collection
- Secure storage in Supabase
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Proper data sanitization

### File Uploads
- File type validation
- Size limitations
- Secure storage in Supabase Storage
- Malware prevention through file type restrictions

## Security Monitoring

### Logging
- Security events logged
- Failed authentication attempts tracked
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Error logging for debugging

### Alerts
- Rate limit violations
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Input validation failures

## Production Security Checklist

### Environment
- [ ] Set secure environment variables
- [ ] Configure HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper DNS records
- [ ] Configure CDN with security features

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up security alerts
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns

### Database
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] Regular backup verification
- [ ] Monitor database access logs
- [ ] Review and update permissions

### Updates
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security patch management
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Penetration testing

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always validate input on both client and server
2. Use parameterized queries for database operations
3. Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Follow principle of least privilege

### For Deployment
1. Use HTTPS everywhere
2. Configure security headers
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Regular security updates
5. Backup and disaster recovery plans

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident
   - Preserve evidence

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and monitoring data
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services
   - Verify security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security measures
   - Improve monitoring
