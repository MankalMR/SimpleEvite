              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Simple Evite was born from a simple observation: creating beautiful event invitations shouldn&apos;t be complicated or expensive.
                As someone who has organized numerous events, I noticed that existing solutions were either too complex, too expensive,
                or lacked the personal touch that makes an invitation special.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Whether it was a birthday party, corporate event, or casual gathering, I found myself spending hours trying to create
                something that looked professional and captured the essence of the event. The available tools either required design
                expertise I didn&apos;t have or charged premium prices for basic functionality.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Vision</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                I envisioned a platform that would democratize beautiful event invitations. A tool that would allow anyone, regardless
                of their design skills or budget, to create stunning invitations that reflect their personal style and the nature of
                their event.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The goal was to make event planning more accessible while maintaining the elegance and personal touch that makes
                invitations meaningful. Simple Evite combines the best of both worlds: professional design templates with the
                flexibility to customize and make each invitation unique.
